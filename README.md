# **The Shopping Cart Program**
### Introduction:
This is a program that adds the prices of many items together and returns the total price.

### How it works:
The program takes the list `cart` and the boolean `discount`. The list `cart` contains the prices of many different items and the program adds every price together and returns the total. If the boolean `discount` is true, the program will lower the total price by 10 percent before returning it.

### Change Log:
- Changed the names of the function and data to make the code more readable  
    - Changed function name from `shop` to `shopping`  
    - Changed boolean name from `d` to `discount`  
    - Changed `x` in loop to `item_price`  
- Added a docstring and type annotation to the function to make it easier to understand
